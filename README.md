# Task-3-Elevate-Labs
This project is a simple REST API built with Node.js and Express to manage a list of books stored in memory. It supports full CRUD operations:  GET /books → fetch all books  POST /books → add a new book  PUT /books/:id → update a book by ID  DELETE /books/:id → delete a book by ID  The API can be tested using Postman or curl.
